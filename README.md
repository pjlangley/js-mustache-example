# mustache.js example

This simple HTML templating example uses **mustache js** to parse a HTML widget. It shows an example of how to perform an *if-like* conditional check. 

Node js is only used to fire up a local web server, as to avoid XSS AJAX issues when using the file:// protocol.

1. `cd` into the directory
2. `npm install`
3. go to http://localhost:3000 and watch the template rendering in action
